# Class XI - List of Additional Questions
## Looping

1. Print all prime numbers in a given range. Take as input "low" and “high”, the lower and upper limits of the range respectively. For the range print all the primes numbers between low and high (both included). <br/>
Sample Input: 6     24 <br/>
Sample Output: 7	11	13	17	19	23<br/>
<br/>

2. The inverse of a number is defined as the number created by interchanging the face value and index of digits of number.e.g. for 426135 (reading from right to left, 5 is in place 1, 3 is in place 2, 1 is in place 3, 6 is in place 4, 2 is in place 5 and 4 is in place 6), the inverse will be 416253 (reading from right to left, 3 is in place 1, 5 is in place 2, 2 is in place 3, 6 is in place 4, 1 is in place 5 and 4 is in place 6). <br/>
The constraint for a number to be inverse is that if the number is 5 digits long, it will contain all the digits from 1 to 5 without missing or repeating any. e.g. 23415 is a 5 digit long number containing all digits from 1 to 5 without missing and repeating any digit. <br/>
Given that the input number from the user follows above constraint, write a program to find inverse of a number.<br/>
Sample Input: 426135<br/>
Sample Output: 416253 <br/>
